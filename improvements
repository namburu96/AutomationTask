Further improvements that could be considered to develop framework:

	Now the code is built in a way that only add to card available products have been added to cart directly. we can develop this to add any product available even of different sizes to cart.

	Multiple pages are there. we can make it work for all pages.

	now we have added first four products in the whole list but we an make it add any random 4 products.

Few other features that can be added to develop it into a full fledged framework:

	Reporting mechanism
	Parallel execution
	Logging
	Retry mechanism
	Cross browser testing integration with browser stack.
